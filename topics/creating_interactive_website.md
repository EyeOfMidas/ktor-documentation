In this hands-on tutorial we're going to create an interactive website using Kotlin and [Ktor](https://ktor.io), a framework for building connected applications.

Using the different features and integrations provided by Ktor, we will see how to host static content like images and HTML pages. We will see how supported HTML templating engines like [Freemarker](http://freemarker.org/) make it easy to control how data from our application is rendered in the browser. By using [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html), we'll learn about a domain-specific language that allows us to mix Kotlin code and markup directly, allowing us to write our site's display logic in pure Kotlin.

## What we will build

The goal of this hands-on is to write a minimal journal app. We'll start by seeing how Ktor can serve static files and pages, and then move on to dynamically rendering Kotlin objects representing blog entries in a nicely formatted fashion, making use of our template engine. To make things interactive, we will add the ability to submit new entries to our journal directly from the browser – leaving us with a nice way to temporarily store and view our thoughts, for example our opinion on working through this hands-on tutorial:

You can find the [template project](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-website-sample) as well as the source code of the [final](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-website-sample/tree/final) application on the corresponding GitHub repository.

Let's dive right in and start setting up our project for development!


## Project Setup

If we were to start a fresh idea from zero, Ktor would have a few ways of setting up a preconfigured Gradle project: [start.ktor.io](https://start.ktor.io/) and the [Ktor IntelliJ IDEA plugin](intellij-idea.xml) make it easy to create a starting-off point for projects using a variety of features from the framework.

For this tutorial, however, we have made a starter template available that includes all configuration and required dependencies for the project.

[Please clone the project repository from GitHub, and open it in IntelliJ IDEA.](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-website-sample/)

The template repository contains a basic Gradle projects for us to build our project. Because it already contains all dependencies that we will need throughout the hands-on, **you don't need to make any changes to the Gradle configuration.**

It is still beneficial to understand what artifacts are being used for the application, so let's have a closer look at our project template and the dependencies and configuration it relies on.

### Dependencies

For this hands-on, the `dependencies` block in our `build.gradle` file is probably the most interesting part:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-core:$ktor_version"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-netty:$ktor_version"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-html-builder:$ktor_version"
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-freemarker:$ktor_version"
    implementation "ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:$logback_version"
}
```
Let's briefly go through these dependencies one-by-one:

- `ktor-server-core` adds Ktor's core components to our project.
- `ktor-server-netty`  adds the [Netty](https://netty.io/) engine to our project, allowing us to use server functionality without having to rely on an external application container.
- `ktor-freemarker` allows us to use the [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) template engine, which we'll use to create the main page of our journal.
- `ktor-html-builder` adds the ability to use [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) directly from within the code. We'll use it to create code that can mix Kotlin logic with HTML markup.
- `logback-classic` provides an implementation of [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/), allowing us to see nicely formatted logs in our console.

### Configurations: application.conf and logback.xml

The repository also includes a basic `application.conf` in HOCON format. Ktor uses this file to determine the port on which it should run, and it also defines the entry point of our application to be `com.jetbrains.handson.website.ApplicationKt.module`. This corresponds to the `Application.module()` function in `Application.kt`, which we'll start modifying in the next section. If you'd like to learn more about how a Ktor server is configured, check out the [](Configurations.xml) topic.

Also included is a `logback.xml` in the `resources` folder, which sets up the basic logging structure for our server. If you'd like to learn more about logging in Ktor, check out the [](logging.md) topic.

Now that we are equipped with some knowledge around all the artifacts we have at our fingertips, we can start by actually writing the first part of our journal app!


## Static files and pages

Before we dive into making a _dynamic_ application, let's start by doing something a bit easier, but probably just as important – let's get Ktor to serve some *static* files.

In the context of our journal, there are a number of things that we probably want to serve as static files – one example being a header image (a logo that identifies our site). Luckily for us, the template repository already has a PNG file included which we can use: `ktor.png` inside the folder `src/main/resources/files`:

![](ktor_image_location.png){width="561"}

For serving static content, we can use a specific [routing](Routing_in_Ktor.md) function already built in to Ktor named [static](Serving_Static_Content.md). The function takes two parameters: the route under which the static content should be made available, and a lambda where we can define the location from where the content should be served. In the file called `Application.kt`, let's change the implementation for `Application.module()` to look like this:

```kotlin
fun Application.module() {
    routing {
        static("/static") {
            resources("files")
        }
    }
}
```

This instructs Ktor that everything under the URL `/static` should be served using the `files` directory inside `resources`.

### Running our application for the first time

_Seeing is believing_ – so lets *see* if our application is performing as expected! We can run our application by pressing the green "play" button next to `fun main(...)` in our `Application.kt`. IntelliJ IDEA will start the application, and after a few seconds, we should see the confirmation that the app is running:

```
[main] INFO  Application - Responding at http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Let's open [`http://localhost:8080/static/ktor.png`](http://localhost:8080/static/ktor.png) in a browser. We see that Ktor serves the static file:

![](ktor_logo_in_browser.png)

Of course, we are not limited to images – HTML files, or CSS and JavaScript would work just as well. We can take advantage of this fact to add a small "About me" page as a first real part of our journal application – a static page that can contain some information about us, this project, or whatever else we might fancy.

To do so, let's create a new file inside `src/main/resources/files/` called `aboutme.html`, and fill it with the following contents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Kotlin Journal</title>
</head>
<body style="text-align: center; font-family: sans-serif">
<img src="/static/ktor.png" alt="ktor logo">
<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Welcome to my static page!</p>
<p>Feel free to take a look around.</p>
<p>Or go to the <a href="/">main page</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

If we re-run the application and navigate to [`http://localhost:8080/static/aboutme.html`](http://localhost:8080/static/aboutme.html), we can see our first page in all its glory. As you can see, we can even reference other static files – like `ktor.png` – inside this HTML.

![](aboutme.png)

Of course, we could also organize our files in subdirectories inside `files`; Ktor will automatically take care of mapping these paths to the correct URLs.

If you'd like to learn more about serving static files with Ktor, check out the [](Serving_Static_Content.md) help topic.

However, a static page that contains a few paragraphs can hardly be called a journal yet. Let's move on and learn about how *templates* can help us in writing pages that contain dynamic content, and how to control them from within our application.



## Home page with templates

It's time to build the main page of our journal which is in charge of displaying multiple journal entries. We will create this page with the help of a *template engine*. Template engines are quite common in web development, and Ktor supports a [variety of them](Working_with_views.md). In our case we're going to choose [FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/).

### Adding FreeMarker as a Ktor feature

[Features](Features.md) are a mechanism that Ktor provides to enable support for certain functionality, such as encoding, compression, logging, authentication, among others. While the implementation details of Ktor features (acting as interceptors / middleware providing extra functionality) aren't relevant for this hands-on tutorial, we will use this mechanism to `install` the `FreeMarker` feature, by adding the following lines to the top of our `Application.module()` definition in the `Application.kt` file:

```kotlin
fun Application.module() {
    install(FreeMarker) {
        templateLoader = ClassTemplateLoader(this::class.java.classLoader, "templates")
        outputFormat = HTMLOutputFormat.INSTANCE
    }
    routing {
        // Our existing code . . .
    }
}
```
In the configuration block for the `FreeMarker` feature, we're passing two parameters:

- The `templateLoader` setting tells our application that FreeMarker templates will be located in the `templates` directory inside our application `resources`: 
  ![Template](templates_location.png){width="566"}
- The `outputFormat` setting helps convert control characters provided by the user to their corresponding HTML entities. This ensures that when one of our journal entries contains a String like `<b>Hello</b>`, it is actually printed as `<b>Hello</b>`, not **Hello**. This so-called [escaping](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui_misc_autoescaping.html) is an essential step in preventing [XSS attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/).

Now that Ktor knows where to find our FreeMarker templates, we can start writing the template for the journal main page.

### Writing the journal template

Our journal main page should contain everything we need for a basic overview of our journal: a title, header image, a list of journal entries, and a form for adding new journal entries. To define this page layout, we use the FreeMarker Template Language (`ftl`), which contains our HTML source as well as FreeMarker variable definitions and instructions on how to use the variables in the context of the page.

Let's create a file called `index.ftl` in the `resources/templates` directory and fill it with the following content:

```xml
<#-- @ftlvariable name="entries" type="kotlin.collections.List<com.jetbrains.handson.website.BlogEntry>" -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Kotlin Journal</title>
</head>
<body style="text-align: center; font-family: sans-serif">
<img src="/static/ktor.png">
<h1>Kotlin Ktor Journal </h1>
<p><i>Powered by Ktor, kotlinx.html & Freemarker!</i></p>
<hr>
<#list entries as item>
    <div>
        <h3>${item.headline}</h3>
        <p>${item.body}</p>
    </div>
</#list>
<hr>
<div>
    <h3>Add a new journal entry!</h3>
    <form action="/submit" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="headline">
        <br>
        <textarea name="body"></textarea>
        <br>
        <input type="submit">
    </form>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

As you can see, we are using FTL syntax to define, access and iterate over variables. The variable `entries` which we loop over has the type `kotlin.collections.List<com.jetbrains.handson.website.BlogEntry>`. This is simply the fully-qualified name of a Kotlin `List<BlogEntry>`. However, we haven't created the `BlogEntry` class yet, but now that we are referencing it, it seems like a good time to fix that!

If you'd like to learn more about FreeMarker's syntax, check out [their official documentation](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/dgui_quickstart.html).

### Defining a model for the journal entries

As defined by our usage in the FreeMarker template, the `BlogEntry` class needs two attributes: a `headline` and a `body`, both of type `String`. Let's create a file named `BlogEntry.kt` next to `Application.kt`, and fill it with the corresponding Kotlin data class, which can then be injected into the template:

```kotlin
package com.jetbrains.handson.website

data class BlogEntry(val headline: String, val body: String)
```

It would also make sense if we defined a temporary storage for our entries. We can do this in the same file as a top-level declaration:

```kotlin
val blogEntries = mutableListOf(BlogEntry(
    "The drive to develop!",
    "...it's what keeps me going."
))
```

At this point, we have defined a template and the model that is will be used for rendering it. Now, Ktor just needs to pass our stored journal entries and serve the resulting page.

### Serving the templated content

The overview page we just templated is the center point of our application. So, it would make sense to make it available under the `/` route. Let's add a route for it to the `routing` block inside our `Application.module()`:


```kotlin
get("/") {
    call.respond(FreeMarkerContent("index.ftl", mapOf("entries" to blogEntries), ""))
}
```

We can now run the application. Opening [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/) in a browser, we should see our header image, headline and subtitle, and a list of journal entries (well, just one for now) alongside a form for submitting new entries:

![FreeMarker Browser Output](main_page.png)

Looks like our display logic is working just fine! Now, we only need to make the "Submit" button work, and we'll be able to view and add new entries for our journal!


## Form submission and kx.html

The `<form>` we defined in the previous chapter sends a `POST` request to `/submit` containing the `headline` and `body` of our new journal entry. Let's make our application correctly consume this information and submission of new journal entries! We define a handler for the `/submit` route inside our `Application.module()`'s `routing` block like this:

```kotlin
post("/submit") {
    val params = call.receiveParameters()
    val headline = params["headline"] ?: return@post call.respond(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest)
    val body = params["body"] ?: return@post call.respond(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest)
    val newEntry = BlogEntry(headline, body)
    blogEntries.add(0, newEntry)
    // TODO: send a status page to the user
}
```

[receiveParameters](requests.md#form_parameters) allows us to parse form data (for both `urlencoded` and `multipart`). We then extract the `headline` and `body` fields from the form, ensuring they are both not null, and create a new `BlogEntry` object from this information, adding it to the beginning of our `blogEntries` list.

For more detailed information on the fancy features that are available in the context of Ktor's request model, check out the [](requests.md) topic.

To show the user that the submission was successful, we still want to send back a bit of HTML. We could re-use our knowledge and create a FreeMarker template for this "Success" page as well – but to cover some more Ktor functionality, we will try an alternative approach instead. When we autocomplete on the `call` object, we can see that Ktor allows us to respond to requests using a variety of functions:

![Respond](respond.png){width="638"}

Amongst these is `call.respondHtml`. This function allows us to craft our HTML response using Kotlin syntax, thanks to Ktor's integration with [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) (a [DSL](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html) designed for seamlessly combining Kotlin code and HTML-like tags).

At the bottom of the `post("/submit")` handler block, let's add the following code:

```kotlin
call.respondHtml {
    body {
        h1 {
            +"Thanks for submitting your entry!"
        }
        p {
            +"We've submitted your new entry titled "
            b {
                +newEntry.headline
            }
        }
        p {
            +"You have submitted a total of ${blogEntries.count()} articles!"
        }
        a("/") {
            +"Go back"
        }
    }
}
```

Notice how this code combines Kotlin-specific logic (like `count`ing the entries, or using string interpolation) with HTML-like syntax!

To test the route, let's re-run our application, navigate to [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/), and submit a new entry. If everything has gone according to play, we'll now see the HTML page, courtesy of kotlinx.html!

![Static HTML](submit.png)

### We're done!

It's time to pat ourselves on the back – we've put together a nice little journal application, and have learned about many topics in the meantime. From static files to templating, from basic routing to kotlinx.html, we've covered a lot of ground.

![](ktor_journal.png){animated="true" width="434"}

This concludes the guided part of this hands-on. We have included the final state of the journal application in the GitHub repository on the [`final` branch](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-website-sample/tree/final). But of course, your journey doesn't have to stop here. Check out the _What's next_ section to get an idea of how you could expand the application, and where to go if you need help in your endeavors!


## What's next

At this point, you should have gotten a basic idea of how to serve static files with Ktor and how the integration of features such as FreeMarker or kotlinx.html can enable you to write basic applications that can even react to user input.

### Feature requests for the journal

At this point, our journal application is still rather barebones, so of course it might be a fun challenge to add more features to the project, and learn even more about building interactive sites with Kotlin and Ktor. To get you started, here's a few ideas of how the application could still be improved, in no particular order:

- **Make it consistent!** You would usually not mix FreeMarker and kotlinx.html – we've taken some liberty here to explore more than one way of structuring your application. Consider powering your whole journal with kotlinx.html or FreeMarker, and make it consistent!
- **Authentication!** Our current version of the journal allows all visitors to post content to our journal. We could use [Ktor's authentication features](authentication.md) to ensure that only select users can post to the journal, while keeping read access open to everyone.
- **Persistence!** Currently, all our journal entries vanish when we stop our application, as we are only storing them in a variable. You could try integrating your application with a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB, using one of the plenty projects that allow database access from Kotlin, like [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) or [KMongo](https://litote.org/kmongo/).
- **Make it look nicer!** The stylesheets for the journal are currently rudimentary at best. Consider creating your own style sheet, and serving it as a static `.css` file from Ktor!
- **Organize your routes!** As the complexity of our application increases, so does the number of routes we try to support. For bigger applications, we usually want to add structure to our routing – like separating routes out into separate files. If you'd like to learn about different ways to organize your routes with Ktor, check out the [](Routing_in_Ktor.md) help topic.
